It is expensive to hold a website server on AWS. Also there are so many random attack from the online to the cloud server. It is not friendly for user who just want to maintain the website for blog&amp;hellip;.
Therefore, starting a static page in github maybe is a easier way for the blog. (For people don&amp;rsquo;t want to use existing online blog plaform)
Hugo There are many syntax and theme. After using the orignal blank version and the minima, hugo seems to be more organize for user who has different topic in one blog (Yes, is me. Putting all the note).
Hugo provide a method to maintain the article organized and sepeate the maintain file and the public file. Also, there are theme in thire website who is free to download. Thank you all of the contributors providing beautiful structure ~~
One more key point is, Hugo provide offline preview with local server. Which means user can preview the blog before upload to github and make it public. Another words, it can be used as a private notes server instand of creating a database server. I created one for saving my gaming walkthroughs in local as a test. it is very useful for someone like me don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a local database server with file system or who want to create their own personal website.</content></entry><entry><title>About Me</title><url>/about.html</url><categories/><tags/><content type="html"> About Me
