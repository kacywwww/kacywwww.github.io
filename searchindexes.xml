Welcome to my blog!
Why GitHub Pages? Github page is offering free online static page. Starting a static page in github maybe is a easier way for individuals who prefer not to rely on existing online blog platforms.
Unlike holding a website server on AWS which can be costly and vulnerable to random attacks from online sources, GitHub Pages provides a user-friendly solution for those who simply want to manage a blog without the complexities of traditional web hosting.
Furture plan The website is updating as this is not the final syntax or style I want and I am continuously working on it. As a software engineer with coding knowledge, I intend to make various changes that align with my vision and preferences.
In addition to refining the website, I am excited to share my journey of continuous learning with all of you. Through blog posts, I will document not only the technical aspects of web development but also other areas of my learning process.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s exploring new programming languages, diving into the world of data science, or uncovering the latest trends in artificial intelligence, I aim to provide valuable insights and resources. By sharing these experiences, I hope to inspire others to embark on their own learning adventures and foster a community of knowledge-sharing.
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
Let&amp;rsquo;s embrace our curiosity and never stop seeking new knowledge.
Thank you for joining me on this exciting blogging journey. I look forward to sharing valuable content and connecting with you all!</content></entry><entry><title>Create Personal Page</title><url>/post/create-personal-page/</url><categories><category>Blog</category></categories><tags><tag>GitHub Page</tag><tag>Hugo</tag></tags><content type="html"><![CDATA[  Why Create Personal Page In the past, I used to maintain a server on AWS, essentially transforming it into my own personalized cloud drive and a platform for writing blogs. However, this setup incurred expenses and proved to be quite challenging to utilize effectively as a blog publishing platform. It felt akin to having a computer online, complete with virtual machines and various tools like lambda. Over time, as AWS expanded with an extensive range of offerings across different domains, it became evident that it was becoming a vast ecosystem with numerous competing components.
Consequently, I made the decision to separate the blog section from AWS and opted to create a Git page specifically dedicated to hosting my blog. This transition enables the Git page to handle all my articles and future notes, while allowing the AWS drive to focus on other topics and functionalities.
Hugo One popular option I explored for my blog is Hugo. This static site generator offers a wide range of syntax and themes. Initially, I experimented with the blank version and later switched to the &ldquo;minima&rdquo; theme. I found that Hugo provides a more organized structure for bloggers who cover diverse topics (like myself, with various notes to compile).
One of the key advantages of Hugo is its ability to maintain articles in an organized manner while separating the maintenance files from the public ones. Additionally, Hugo&rsquo;s website features numerous free themes available for download, thanks to the contributions of the community. These themes offer visually appealing structures that enhance the overall appearance of the blog.
Another noteworthy feature of Hugo is its offline preview capability using a local server. This means that users can preview their blogs before uploading them to GitHub or making them public. In other words, Hugo can function as a private notes server, eliminating the need for a separate database server. I personally created one to save my gaming walkthroughs locally as a test, and I found it extremely useful. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals who do not wish to set up a local database server with a file system or those who want to create their own personal websites.
Overall, Hugo provides a powerful and efficient solution for organizing and managing blog articles while offering convenient offline preview capabilities, making it an ideal choice for bloggers with diverse topics and preferences.
Create GitHub Page To create a GitHub page, you&rsquo;ll need to follow these steps:
Create a new repository Go to GitHub ( https://github.com/ ) and sign in to your account. Click on the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button in the top-right corner and select &ldquo;New repository&rdquo;. Set up your repository Name your repository as &ldquo;username.github.io&rdquo;, where &ldquo;username&rdquo; is your GitHub username. Ensure that the repository is Public. As I already have a Git page set up, there is a notification in red text, reminding me that the repository already exists. However, this reminder will not displayed when user create the repository at the first time. Finish the rest of the items, such as adding adding a description, selecting a license or adding a README file. But these are not necessary for creating a GitHub page.
Quick Start This section is introduces a way to kickstart the GitHub Page with simple display. There are some document on github teaching how to start a GitHub Page easily. For example: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart Also, there are many templates with different format on the internet are free to use. In the later blog, I will introduce minima and Hugo which are the theme for the GitHub Page.
